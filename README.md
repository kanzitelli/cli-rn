Purpose of [cli-rn](https://github.com/kanzitelli/cli-rn) is to simplify and accelerate the process of React Native App development. It is not a replacer for react-native cli but a good addition!

## Quick start

```bash
> npx cli-rn new App

# or install it globally first
> npm i -g cli-rn
> cli-rn new App
```

It will generate a new production-ready Expo (React Native) App bootstrapped from [expo-starter](https://github.com/kanzitelli/expo-starter).

For [React Native Navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) (by Wix) setup:

```bash
> cli-rn new App -t rnn
```

For [React Navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) (w/out Expo) setup:

```bash
> cli-rn new App -t rn
```

Example with all possible options:

```bash
> cli-rn new App -b com.company.App -t expo
```

### > cli-rn new --help

```
Usage: cli-rn new [options] <App>

Generates a new production ready React Native App. Try it: > cli-rn new app
