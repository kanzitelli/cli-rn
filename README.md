Purpose of [cli-rn](https://github.com/kanzitelli/cli-rn) is to simplify and accelerate the process of React Native App development. It is not a replacer for react-native cli but a good addition!

### Quick start

```bash
> npm i -g cli-rn
> cli-rn new AppName
```

It will generate a new production-ready React Native App bootstrapped from [rn-starter](https://github.com/kanzitelli/rn-starter) with [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation) preconfigured.

If you'd like to use [React Native Navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) by Wix, you can run:

```bash
> cli-rn new AppName -n rnn
```

Example with all possible options:

```bash
> cli-rn new MyNewApp -b com.mycompany.MyNewApp -n rn
```

#### > cli-rn --help
